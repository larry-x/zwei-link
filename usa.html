		<p>I'm traveling the country, stopping at certain cities for a while, and chronicling tidbits of that journey here.</p>
        <p>My starting point was Plano, Texas. This is my car parking in a rest area somewhere in west Texas.</p>

		<p>The crosses. Almost like crossroads. As if once you cross there's no turning back. I feel like I'm again and again taken to this spot in my life. Where I must make a decision but both options are wrong.</p>
        <img class="photo" src="images/organ.jpg">
		<p>But that's what makes the Organ Mountains so beautiful. Very difficult hike, 5.5 hours after the losing the trail several times. Did not bring food, almost ran out of energy, but managed to stumble down to the base.</p>

		<p>The bird that revives. The byproduct of that heat resulted in the sunshine state. I'm kidding.</p>
        <img class="photo" src="images/arizona.jpg">
		<p>There's something charming about building a city in the desert. Also, did not expect to spend almost 2 hours in a laundromat. Got what looked like bed bug bites after staying at an AirBnb. Laundered everything just in case.</p>

		<p>LA is BIG, but I stayed in two cities in East LA while driving throughout the metro. I've gotten into the trend of hiking a different mountain every day.</p>
        <img class="photo" src="images/hike.jpg">
		<p>There's an unexpected pleasant air in the city of [fallen] angels that comes from the breeze and the plentiful flowers and plants here. I really liked these purple trees, which were blooming here and there, and their fragrance.</p>
		<img class="photo" src="images/purple.jpg">
		<p>I also visited the first apartment I lived at after immigrating from China, Chino Hills State Park among other places, and met up with old acquaintances and friends.</p>
		<img class="photo" src="images/ontario.jpg">
		<p>It seems like every day is filled with activity. Maybe it's because I've become a programmer, but my writing has become terse.</p>

		<p>Death Valley gets a surprising number of visitors. Mining used to be done here. The drive there involved some intensely long uphills and downhills.</p>
        <img class="photo" src="images/deathvalleyroad.jpg">
		<p>Afternoon temperatures were in the upper 90s.</p>
		<img class="photo" src="images/deathvalley1.jpg">
		<p>The lowest spot in the park and the place where the world heat record was set.</p>
		<img class="photo" src="images/deathvalley2.jpg">
		<p>I set up camp in Furnace Creek and watched the stars in the dark night sky. Neither of which I have pictures of. But the next day I climbed to the highest point in Death Valley National Park, Telescope Peak. At 14 miles roundtrip it was one of the longest hikes I've been.</p>
		<img class="photo" src="images/telescopepeak.jpg">
		<p>As I drove out of the park up the eastern side of the Sierras I was able to capture this beautiful scenery.</p>

		<p>Can you guess where I'm headed?</p>

		<p>Nevada is big on mining. You may not have known but the state is a major miner for gold. Reno is a pretty town, once again surrounded by mountains like the other places I stopped.</p>
        <img class="photo" src="images/reno.jpg">
		<p>Maybe my favorite or second favorite climbing experience was had here, at Mount Rose.</p>
		<img class="photo" src="images/rose.jpg">
		<p>There was snow at the top. I got carried away "skiing" on the way down that I ended up on the wrong face of the mountain and had to navigate back. Yes the shoes were wet and my feet got cold.</p>
		<img class="photo" src="images/snow.jpg">
		<p>On the way to my next destination I stopped to drive for a bit in Bonneville Salt Flats. Getting out of the car I began to walk / run. I may also have set a personal 150ish meter land speed record here.</p>

		<p>I stayed in Honeyville but did the majority of my exploration in Logan, which .. is .. paradise.</p>
        <img class="photo" src="images/idyllic.jpg">
		<p>It felt so peaceful and idyllic. I didn't know Utah could be this green. But in fact it was just this area, as surrounding areas are not as green. Here is Utah State front lawn.</p>
		<img class="photo" src="images/usu.jpg">
		<p>There's a road and a river that goes through Logan Canyon. I hiked there in the midst of new greenery, flowers, and bugs.</p>
		<img class="photo" src="images/logan.jpg">
		<p>The second hike was located in a different but equally green mountain pass. AllTrails reviewers jokingly referred to it as stairmaster 5000. On the difficult parts of the hike I amused myself with the thought that I was in a real life simulation of said program.</p>
