		<p>I'm traveling the country, stopping at certain cities for a while, and chronicling tidbits of that journey here.</p>
        <p>My starting point was Plano, Texas. This is my car parking in a rest area somewhere in west Texas.</p>

		<p>There's something charming about building a city in the desert. Also, did not expect to spend almost 2 hours in a laundromat. Got what looked like bed bug bites after staying at an AirBnb. Laundered everything just in case.</p>
