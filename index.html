		<p>In your deepest dreams you are able to see it: the foe with which you struggle with: the demon which possesses your mind and drives it to insanity. In those moments it appears like existence is once again real and you are healed of this belief called reality. Upon waking the enlightenment lasts for a brief while, your mind clear as if like the reflection from a still pond. Still lucid you see the dream overtake your view again.</p>
		<p>They say that imagination sets you free, but from the same place that sprung the imagination is born the fetters that limit your experience. In those moments when I realize I was truly awake I become cognizant that my waking life is but 10% of what is really there, 10% being less a number and more an expression. Was it that we could not handle life at 100%? Or does the brain weaken in its ability to translate the richness of life through its lifetime of being assailed, both physically and spiritually? Probably this is part of our purpose here: to experience life, not as a soul, but as a soul in a mind, in a body. Good night. Tomorrow morning when I wake up I will try once again to resume awakening.</p>

	<div class ="chapter"><p>History 1989 - 2002</p>
		I was born in a large industrial city in Northeast China at a time when Soviet communism was dismantling and Chinese communism oversaw a famous incident. Just before starting grade school I immigrated to the United States with my parents, and then to Canada. We moved a lot, so I would subsequently attend 4 elementary schools, 3 middle schools, and 4 high schools. I believe this is my biggest accomplishment as a child. ;P

		If you get writer's block, hash it and start a blockchain. Each block will record your futile attempts at producing something. Then have that blockchain kept on thousands of servers around the world documenting your embarrassing fails in full detail for time immemorial. See, it's not so bad to publish something while you have writer's block.

	<div class="chapter"><p>welcome to the global masquerade</p>
		 The coronavirus pandemic makes for a great analogy. The world is a masquerade. We are all wearing masks (our bodies, our personalities). We are here to participate in the party. You decide what kind of mask(s) to wear. You decide how to 'party'. People sometimes take life too seriously. The earth doesn't need you to go on. Your country doesn't need you. Your job doesn't even need you. So why are we here? To bring life to the party in our unique ways (which could be living as a hermit). You come with nothing to lose and everything to gain. The 'you' beneath the mask cannot be destroyed and is already perfect. But the you that the world perceives is different from 'you' beneath the mask. 'You' have the freedom to choose or alter your mask at any time. The problem is after a while people identify with their mask rather than with their actual 'you'. They become stuck, rigid. They begin to follow rules no one set for them. Adhere to the static program as dictated by the mask. What some writers call "the flow" is just a drunken stupor where you lose yourself and nothing matters, which means your next move is everything. The present is magnified to its rightful place because we don't occupy ourselves with what our masks believe to be "important". Note that this does not necessarily involve consuming alcohol ;) This doesn't mean that nothing matters and there are no consequences to our actions. But if we let our masks decide these things and go about conducting our lives as masks, then the party cannot truly begin.

	<div class="chapter"><p>History 2003 - 2015</p> 
		<p>I was an academic achiever in high school, PSAT 222, SAT meh bombed the writing section (can you tell?), full scholarship to college. By my second year I wanted to drop out, chickened out, and instead finished with a degree in arts and technology (seemed more liberating than the institutional subjects I studied in school. Plus I was interested in game design).</p>
		<p>Having not had an internal compass for the past 4 years I applied for some jobs, didn't find anything, and moved to another city in another country to explore local bakeries and be partially employed as a food server. After a few months I moved back into my mom's house (would be her basement if she had one), did some more restaurant work, moved out to another city in another country, moved back, moved to another city in another state, moved back, and repeat one more time. By then I had enough W-2s from all my employers to make a children's book. Meanwhile, my straight C's friend had graduated PT school and was making 60 a year.</p>
		<p>Delicious irony. This is why I love to crack open the guise of intelligence and strip it from its pedestal. Brains are good, yea, if you know how to use them. If not they will use you. They will cause you to worry more, overthink more, waste energy dealing with unwanted thoughts and feelings, maybe even go mad. I was so smart I got out-smarted by my mind. But from this point on I began to regain the reins.</p>
